# Shopping Manager Python-project


Project Name: Shopping List Manager System - Python

Project Created By: Aniket Sandip Babar, Student of Computer Engineering Department, Amrutwahini College of Engineering (under Zensar SQL and Python Training)

Project Description:
The Shopping List Manager System is a Python-based project designed to efficiently manage shopping lists, categorize items, and streamline the purchasing process. The system is built using Python with functionalities for creating and managing personalized shopping lists, adding items to specific categories (such as groceries, electronics, or stationery), and tracking item statuses. The project also includes a feature to notify users when all items in a shopping list are marked as purchased, improving user experience. The system implements real-time tracking of items and incorporates object-oriented programming concepts for efficient data management.

Key Features:

Categorized Shopping Management: Allows items to be categorized into predefined groups such as groceries, clothes, stationery, household items, and electronics for better management and organization.
Mark as Purchased Feature: Implements Python functions to dynamically update the status of items, enabling users to track purchases in real-time.
Automated Notifications: Uses Pythonâ€™s functionality to check and notify users when all items in a specific shopping list have been purchased.
Data Integrity: Ensures data consistency by using object-oriented programming to manage shopping lists and items in a structured and efficient manner.
Objective:
The objective of this project is to create a comprehensive Python-based system for managing shopping lists. It helps users categorize their shopping items, track their purchase statuses, and receive automated notifications once all items are marked as purchased. This project enhances the efficiency and organization of shopping-related tasks.

Technologies Used:
Python, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Lists and Dictionaries (for data management)

Conclusion:
The Shopping List Manager System built with Python provides a user-friendly platform for managing shopping activities. It enables categorized shopping, real-time item status tracking, and automated notifications when all items in a shopping list are marked as purchased. The project enhances efficiency and organization while ensuring consistency across shopping data.

Guidance:
This project was created under the guidance of Sir Anirudh Gaikwad. Python's object-oriented programming features were utilized to manage data and ensure a scalable, efficient system. For testing and implementing various features such as adding items, marking them as purchased, and checking notifications, users can run the Python scripts in any IDE or Python environment.
